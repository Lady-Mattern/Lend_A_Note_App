### About Lend A Note
Lend A Note is an application designed for school music programs to lend their sheet music out to other schools in need. 

This idea for this application came from my experience teaching music in small school districts. The schools would have large libraries of sheet music, but the music was designed for very large, and well advanced ensembles. The groups that I would see where anywhere from five to maybe twenty students in size.
